### 🔧 Step-by-Step Guide to Build Password Strength Meter App in Streamlit

---

#### 🪄 Step 1: Import Required Libraries  
```python
import re  
import random  
import string  
import streamlit as st  
```
📌 These libraries help with password checking, generating strong passwords, and building the Streamlit GUI.

---

#### 📵 Step 2: Define a List of Common Weak Passwords  
```python
blacklist = ['password123', '123456', 'qwerty', 'admin', 'letmein']
```
❌ These are insecure and common passwords that your app will reject.

---

#### 🧠 Step 3: Create a Function to Check Password Strength  
```python
def check_password_strength(password):
    # Check for length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters
```
🔍 This function analyzes the user's password and gives feedback on how strong it is.

---

#### 🔐 Step 4: Create a Function to Generate Strong Passwords  
```python
def generate_strong_password(length=12):
    # Returns a random, strong password
```
🎲 This function creates a strong password using letters, numbers, and symbols.

---

#### 🌐 Step 5: Design Streamlit GUI  
```python
def main():
    st.markdown(...)  # Title and credits
    st.image(...)     # Show icon image
```
🖼️ You added a **title**, **emoji icon**, and developer **credits** using `st.markdown()` and `st.image()`.

---

#### 🌈 Step 6: Set a Background Image with Custom CSS  
```python
st.markdown("""
    <style>
        body {
            background-image: url('image.png');
            ...
        }
    </style>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```
🎨 You made the app visually appealing by using a custom background image.

---

#### 🔑 Step 7: Take User Input for Password  
```python
password = st.text_input("🔑 Enter your password:", type="password")
```
💬 This allows users to enter a password, and it hides the input for security.

---

#### 🧾 Step 8: Analyze Password and Show Feedback  
```python
if password:
    score, feedback = check_password_strength(password)
    # Display result: Weak, Moderate, or Strong
```
🧠 Your app gives **real-time analysis** of password strength with emoji-based feedback.

---

#### 🎲 Step 9: Generate Strong Password on Button Click  
```python
if st.button("🎲 Generate a Strong Password"):
    new_password = generate_strong_password()
```
⚡ If user clicks the button, your app shows a **secure, random password**.

---

#### 🧼 Step 10: Add Final Touch with Watermark  
```python
st.markdown("...Created by Ammara Dawood...")
```
🌟 You gave yourself credit at the bottom with a clean horizontal line and glowing text.
